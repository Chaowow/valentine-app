Valentine App
A fun and silly React app that asks users if they want to be your Valentine.

Description
This app is a playful way to ask someone to be your Valentine. It starts by giving them a choice to say "Yes" or "No." If they click "No," the "No" button transforms and asks if they are sure. If they click "No" again, the "No" button becomes more emphatic and positive, while the "Yes" button increases in size.
